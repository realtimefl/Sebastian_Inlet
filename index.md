  <h1>Model Setup </h1>
   <p> A numerical model has been developed using <a href="https://oss.deltares.nl/web/delft3d">Delft3D</a>, 3-dimensional modeling suite for hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphology and water quality for estuarine and coastal environments. A curvilinear orthogonal grid was created with grid size ranging from 14 m in inlet to 475 m in the coastal area and with 5 sigma layers.  The grid represents coastline from Wabasso Beach to Indialantic Beach.
